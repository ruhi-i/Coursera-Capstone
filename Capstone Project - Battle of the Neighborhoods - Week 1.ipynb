    "**Real Estate Investment** involves purchasing, managing, renting and selling real or physical property, for a profit.\n",
    "Such an investment is characterised by a large amount of capital, and involves careful planning and decision making, for it to be a successful one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Neighbourhood-wise Analysis** of **Residential Real Estate** in the **140 Neighbourhoods of Toronto**, to determine which Neighbourhood would potentially offer a good return on investment, is the *goal of this project*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Toronto** is the largest and most populous city in Canada, known for being *diverse, multicultural and home to world class-amenities*, making it a great place to invest in a house!\n",
    "\n",
    "When investing in a property, an overall market analysis will provide a good idea of the trends , but will not suffice. It is imperative to buy property in the **right neighbourhood**, because even if the overall market is great, a wrong location may lead to decreased property value in the future.\n",

    "#### Data pertaining to the following factors is used in the Neighbourhood Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Location** : \n",
    "\n",

    "**Amenities** are enhancing features, which benefit a location, contribute to its enjoyment and *increase its value*.  Amenities include parks,hospitals,restaurants,gyms etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Demographics** : \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Population, Age, Educational Attainment, Crime Rate and Median Income Levels** of a Neighbourhood, have a great impact on the *value and investment potential* of the Houses in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it's essential to analyze the Demographics of neighbourhoods, and rank them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Demographic data is taken from the **'Neighbourhood Profiles'** Dataset of the [City of Toronto’s Open                             Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhood-profiles/).\n",
